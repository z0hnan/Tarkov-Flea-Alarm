A discord bot that pings you when an item reaches a set price, and can check prices on demand

Right now this bot can only check prices on demand. But i plan on adding features to daily send the prices on your favourite items. And of course the feature to ping you when an item reaches a sertain price.

To use this bot you need to create a discord bot and insert its token at the bottom.
You also need a newer version of Python, and finally install the packages that are commented out at the top.

This code is best run on a raspberry pi as it needs to be up constantly
